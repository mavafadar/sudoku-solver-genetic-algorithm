# Sudoku Solver using Genetic Algorithm

## Introduction
This project is a solution to the popular puzzle game - Sudoku, using a genetic algorithm. It takes an incomplete 9x9 grid as input and outputs a complete grid with unique numbers in each row, column and 3x3 sub-grid.

## Features
 - Solves 9x9 Sudoku puzzles
 - A user-friendly interface for inputting puzzle and viewing solution
 - Implements a genetic algorithm to solve the puzzle
 - Option to specify the population size and number of generations for the algorithm

## Requirements
This project requires `Python 3.x` to run.

## Installation
No installation is required for this project. Simply download the source code and run it using the usage instructions.

## Usage
To run the project, open the terminal and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command:
```
python ./src/main.py
```

## TODO
- [ ] Improve User-interface
- [ ] Add progress bar when solving the sudoku
- [ ] Improve the efficiency of the algorithm
- [ ] Ask for the `population_size` and `number_of_generations` from the user
